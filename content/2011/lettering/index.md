Have you ever dreamed of having down-to-the-letter control of type in CSS?

[Lettering.js](http://letteringjs.com/) is a simple yet ingenious [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin which allows you tweak the typography of your site. It allows you to target specific letters, words, or lines within a text element by wrapping them in spans. You can then use CSS selectors to drill down to the precise span and tweak to your heart's content.
