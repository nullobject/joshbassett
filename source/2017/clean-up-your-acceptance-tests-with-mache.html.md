title: Clean Up Your Acceptance Tests with Mâché

Tests that drive the UI of your web application are typically brittle, because
any changes to the HTML or JavaScript implementation of your pages can
potentially break the tests that depend on them.

[Mâché](https://github.com/nullobject/mache) (pronounced "mash-ay") is a tool
that helps you to write cleaner and more expressive acceptance tests for your
Ruby web applications using page objects.

## What is a page object?

A [page object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) is a data
structure that provides an interface to your web application for the purposes
of test automation. For example, it could represent a single HTML page, or
perhaps even a fragment of HTML on a page.

From Martin Fowler:

> A page object wraps an HTML page, or fragment, with an application-specific
> API, allowing you to manipulate page elements without digging around in the
> HTML.

[Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) can get us part of the way
there. It allows us to work with an API rather than manipulating the HTML
directly, but what it provides isn't an *application specific* API. It gives us
low-level API methods like `find`, `fill_in`, and `click_button`, but it
doesn't provide us with high-level methods to do things like "sign in to the
app" or "click the Dashboard item in the navigation bar".

This is where page objects come in. Using Mâché we can for instance define a
page object class called `SignInPage` and use it any time we want to automate
authenticating with our app. It could handle visiting the sign in page,
entering the user's credentials, and clicking the "Sign in" button.

## Mâché

Let's dive straight in and take a look at an example. Consider the following
HTML fragment for the welcome page in our app:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/foo" class="selected">foo</a></li>
        <li><a href="/bar">bar</a></li>
        <li><a href="/baz">baz</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
      lorem ipsum
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

To define a `WelcomePage` page object class to wrap this HTML page, we extend
the `Mache::Page` class. The only method our class needs to provide is `path`,
this tells Mâché where to go when we want to visit the page:

```ruby
class WelcomePage < Mache::Page
  def path
    "/welcome"
  end
end
```

We can visit our welcome page using our page object:

```ruby
page = WelcomePage.visit
page.current? # true
```

Mâché also handily exposes the Capybara API on our page object:

```ruby
page.find("main").text # "lorem ipsum"
```

### Elements

To make our page object more useful, we can define an element on our page
object class using the `element` macro. An element is simply an HTML element
that we expect to find on the page using a CSS selector.

Let's define a `main` element to represent the main section of our HTML page:

```ruby
class WelcomePage < Mache::Page
  element :main, "main"

  def path
    "/welcome"
  end
end
```

We can query the `main` element as an attribute of our page object:

```ruby
page.main.text # "lorem ipsum"
```

### Components

For elements that can be shared across any number of page object classes it may
be useful to define a reusable component by extending the `Mache::Node` class.
A component can contain any number of elements (or even other components).

Let's define a `Header` component to represent the header of our HTML page:

```ruby
class Header < Mache::Node
  element :title, "h1"
end
```

We can mount the `Header` component in our page object class at a given CSS
selector using the `component` macro:

```ruby
class WelcomePage < Mache::Page
  component :header, Header, "header"
  element :main, "main"

  def path
    "/welcome"
  end
end
```

Querying a component of our page object is much the same as for an element:

```ruby
page.header.title.text # "Welcome"
```

## Writing acceptance tests with page objects

Let's look at a more complete example for our `WelcomePage`. Note that the
`Header`, `NavItem`, and `Nav` components can be reused in any other page
object classes we may define later for our web application.

```ruby
class Header < Mache::Node
  element :title, "h1"
end

class NavItem < Mache::Node
  def selected?
    node[:class].include?("selected")
  end
end

class Nav < Mache::Node
  components :items, NavItem, "a"

  def selected_item
    items.find(&:selected?)
  end
end

class WelcomePage < Mache::Page
  component :header, Header, "header"
  component :nav, Nav, "nav"
  element :main, "main"

  def path
    "/welcome"
  end
end

feature "Welcome page" do
  let(:home_page) { WelcomePage.visit }

  scenario "A user visits the welcome page" do
    expect(home_page).to be_current

    # header
    expect(home_page).to have_header
    expect(home_page.header.title).to eq("Welcome")

    # nav
    expect(home_page).to have_nav
    expect(home_page.nav).to have_items
    expect(home_page.nav.items.count).to be(3)
    expect(home_page.nav.items[0].text).to eq("foo")
    expect(home_page.nav.items[1].text).to eq("bar")
    expect(home_page.nav.items[2].text).to eq("baz")
    expect(home_page.nav.selected_item).to eq("foo")

    # main
    expect(home_page.main.text).to eq("lorem ipsum")
  end
end
```
